The reason behind this converter was the fact that most of previously created apps and tools (e.g. Number Words) of the same kind 
contain pretty big amounts of code (unnecessarily overcomplicated) and sometimes not working properly (Online converter tools like 
easycalculation.com or tools4noobs.com-- both are working wrong for Russian. 
Actually almost all so called "universal converters" are working wrong for complex languages like Russian.

And well known "Number Words" script doesn't support PHP 7.0+. This one does.
 
Currently uses only Russian wording.

USAGE

1. First of all, include your autoload.php file and type use statement like this:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Converter\Core\Number2Text;
```

Guide -> work in progress. Will be completed very soon!
