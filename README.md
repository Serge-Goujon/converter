Converter of numeric values to their written representation.

The reason behind this converter was the fact that most 
of previously created apps and tools (e.g. Number Words) of the same kind 
contain pretty big amounts of code (unnecessarily 
overcomplicated) and sometimes not working properly (Online converter tools). 

This converter requires PHP 7.0+ to work properly, but I think that someday I will remove code hinting (introduced in PHP7) I used for purely dev purpose, so the converter could work with earlier PHP versions.

Currently only Russian language is supported since it was intended for converting numeric values to text/written representation for accounting software in Russia.
