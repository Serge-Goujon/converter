Converts given numeric value to its text representation.

The reason behind this converter was the fact that most of previously created apps and tools (e.g. Number Words) of the same kind 
contain pretty big amounts of code (unnecessarily overcomplicated) and sometimes not working properly (Online converter tools like 
easycalculation.com or tools4noobs.com-- both are working wrong for Russian. 
Actually almost all so called "universal converters" are working wrong for complex langages like Russian.

This converter requires PHP 7.0+ to work properly. 

Currently only Russian language is supported since this converter was initially created in VBA for accounting software in Russia.

Usage: 
1. Procedural approach: 
Put data.json, test.php and Num2Txt_Converter.php to your WebDir and run test.php.

2. Class approach: 
Put data.json and converter.php to your WebDir and run converter.php on your server.

`TODO: Implement this converter as a Class. DONE!
